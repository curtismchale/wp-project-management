# Project Management for WordPress

This plugin is intended to let you run your projects from within WordPress. It will have little admin interface but will work on the WordPress frontend.

## Proposed Roadmap

Here is my tentative plan for features in the plugin. I bet they'll change a bit but here it is for now.

0.1

- client and company management
	- you will be able to add companies and link contacts to those companies

0.2

- project management
	- add projects and link companies/users to projects

0.3

- task management
	- add tasks to those projects including status, due dates, completed, assign to users, set time estimates...

0.4

- set up hours per week for users
	- you can really only work so many hours in a week so I'm going to take a set number of hours per week and give that to a users and you will get warnings if you assign tasks that take more than the time given

0.5

- a proper theme
	- not really a plugin feature but you will have a mobile friendly theme that is meant to work with the plugin

0.6

- internationalization & security
	- really give it a good cleaning on internationalization and security

0.7

- cake just because I think I'll deserve it by this point
